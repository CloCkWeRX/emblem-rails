# Emblem::Rails

Integrate [Emblem.js](https://github.com/machty/emblem.js) with ember-rails

## Installation

Add `gem 'emblem-rails'` to your application's Gemfile after `ember-rails`:

    gem 'ember-rails'
    gem 'emblem-rails'

If you are running Ember v.1.rc, which depends on Handlebars rc.3, you
must (for now) specify the following:

    gem 'barber-emblem', github: 'machty/barber-emblem'

And then execute:

    $ bundle
